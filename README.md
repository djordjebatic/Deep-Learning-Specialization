# Deep Learning Specialization
The Deep Learning Specialization represents a series of online courses offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai) and taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. 

In addition to the fantastic lectures and programming assignments, you can also watch interviews with many leading researchers in Deep Learning. Solutions are released only for reference purpose.
